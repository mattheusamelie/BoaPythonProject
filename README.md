# BoA Python Project

by Natalie Wu and Amelie Mattheus 

A small game where players compare stats, similar to the Top Trumps card game. 

The basic flow of the games is:
1. You are given a random character with different stats
2. You select one of the character's stats
3. Another random character is selected for your opponent (the computer)
4. The stats of the two characters are compared
5. The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins
