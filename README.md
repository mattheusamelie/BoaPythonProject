# BoA Python Project

by Natalie Wu and Amelie Mattheus 

A small game where players compare stats, similar to the Top Trumps card game. 

The basic flow of the games is:
1. Player 1 is given two random characters with different stats
2. Player 1 has to select one of the characters 
3. Player 1 selects their chosen character's stats
4. Another random character is selected for Player 2
5. Player 2 has to select the character's stats to compete with Player 1 
6. The stats of the two characters are compared
7. The player with the stat higher than their opponent wins
